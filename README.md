# python-challenge (Module 3 Challenge)
## PyBank
The script reads a financial dataset in a CSV format to generate a financial analysis.
### Data
The CSV file 'budget_data.csv' is located in 'PyBank/Resources' and contains two columns, 'date' and 'Profits/Losses'. The file's first row is a header row.
### Operation
Operating the code only involves running the file 'main.py'. The analysis will be printed out on the terminal and also saved as a text file 'pybank_analysis.txt' in 'PyBank/analysis'.
### Analysis Interpretation
The analysis outputs these metrics:  
Total months: The total number of months included in the dataset. 
Total: The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period 
Average Change: The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes 
Greatest Increase in profits: The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Greatest Decrease in profits: The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
